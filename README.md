Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets
Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not. Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), specifically LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM architectures, the model classifies tweets based on their textual content.

Dataset
The dataset is from the Kaggle competition: Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets.

Train Dataset: train.csv - Contains 7,613 tweets with labels.
Test Dataset: test.csv - Contains 3,263 tweets without labels.
Each dataset includes:

id: Unique identifier for each tweet.
keyword: Keyword from the tweet (may be blank).
location: Location the tweet was sent from (may be blank).
text: Text content of the tweet.
target: (Only in train.csv) 1 if the tweet is about a real disaster, 0 otherwise.

Results
Best Model: Bidirectional LSTM
Validation F1 Score: Approximately 0.76
Key Findings:
Text cleaning and preprocessing significantly improve model accuracy.
Bidirectional LSTM captures context more effectively than unidirectional models.
Hyperparameter tuning enhances performance marginally but is crucial for optimization.
Future Work
Pre-trained Embeddings: Integrate GloVe or Word2Vec for better word representations.
Advanced Architectures: Experiment with transformers and attention mechanisms.
Ensemble Methods: Combine multiple models to improve prediction robustness.
